## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

### 1️⃣ Install Rust & Cargo-Make

Ensure [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) is installed, then install Cargo-Make:

```bash
cargo install --force cargo-make
```

---

### 2️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/v3dant21/grpc-todo.git
cd grpc-todo
```

---

### 3️⃣ Setup the SQLite Database

Ensure you have SQLite installed, then run the migration:

```bash
cargo run -p grpc-todo --bin migrate
```

---

### 4️⃣ Run the Full App

Start both backend and frontend with one command:

```bash
cargo make run-both
```

This will:
- Launch the gRPC backend  
- Serve the HTMX + Warp frontend
